The key to a great steak, no matter the cut is allowing the steak to come up to room temperature before cooking. Second is seasoning, coarse sea salt and black pepper. I occasionally add cayenne pepper to make things a little interesting, but that's IT nothing else! The final constant is marking the outside of the steak with a hot 550+ grill or skillet. From here, the cut of meat determines the method of cooking. One of my favorites is the filet minon cut. Marking each side in a HOT skillet including the sides of the steak...about 45 seconds each, then put in the oven to finish @350 5-15 minutes depending on doneness... Let rest for 5-10 minutes before serving..
