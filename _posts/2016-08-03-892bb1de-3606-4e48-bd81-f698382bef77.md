# Good Burger
![The secret to the best burger](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/143f0d91-bd50-40f3-85ee-c5ca7a80abde.jpg)

The secret to a good burger is ground beef that has come up to room temp. For many reasons most people are afraid of this, when a patty is fully cooked it is much more likely to be "safe".. In addition, the fat can actually render which is what sets apart a hand-formed patty because not being pressed from a machine gives the burger personality as well as space for the fat to trickle into all parts of the meat. Cooking meat that is not cold allows the outside of the meat to not be dry before the inside is cooked.

Ground beef NEEDS seasoning, add it while mixing your patty.

Burgers NEED cheese, preferably sharp cheddar.

Buns need to be toasted or they get nasty.
