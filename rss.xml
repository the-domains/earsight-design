            <title><![CDATA[Filet Minon]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Filet Minon</h1><p>The key to a great steak, no matter the cut is allowing the steak to come up to room temperature before cooking. Second is seasoning, coarse sea salt and black pepper. I occasionally add cayenne pepper to make things a little interesting, but that's IT nothing else! The final constant is marking the outside of the steak with a hot 550+ grill or skillet. From here, the cut of meat determines the method of cooking. One of my favorites is the filet minon cut. Marking each side in a HOT skillet including the sides of the steak...about 45 seconds each, then put in the oven to finish @350 5-15 minutes depending on doneness... Let rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a9625be-2c04-45b6-9a07-f86f39641fe9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Good Burger]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Good Burger</h1><p>The secret to a good burger is ground beef that has come up to room temp. For many reasons most people are afraid of this, when a patty is fully cooked it is much more likely to be “safe”.. In addition, the fat can actually render which is what sets apart a hand-formed patty because not being pressed from a machine gives the burger personality as well as space for the fat to trickle into all parts of the meat. Cooking meat that is not cold allows the outside of the meat to not be dry before the inside is cooked.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/143f0d91-bd50-40f3-85ee-c5ca7a80abde.jpg"></article>]]></description>
